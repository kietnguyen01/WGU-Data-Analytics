# WGU Data Analytics Program

Courses and projects for WGU Data Analytics program. Only courses containing code and reports will be included here.

## D206: Data Cleaning

This course builds proficiency with data preparation. Addresses exploring, transforming, and imputing data as well as handling outliers. Writes code to manipulate, structure, and clean data as well as to reduce features in data sets.

## D207: Exploratory Data Analysis

This course covers statistical principles. Computes and interpret measures of central tendency, correlations, and variation. Introduces hypothesis testing, focusing on application for parametric tests. Addresses communication skills and tools to explain an analyst’s findings to others within an organization.

## D208: Predictive Modeling

This course builds on initial data preparation, cleaning, and analysis. Conducts logistic regression and multiple regression to model the phenomena revealed by data. Covers normality, homoscedasticity, and significance. Communicates findings and the limitations of those findings accurately to organizational leaders.

## D209: Data Mining I

This course expands predictive modeling into nonlinear dimensions, enhancing the capabilities and effectiveness of models. Implements supervised models—specifically classification and prediction data mining models. Identifies relationships among variables that are not apparent with more surface-level techniques. Provides frameworks for assessing models’ sensitivity and specificity.

## D210: Representation and Reporting

This course focuses on communicating observations and patterns to diverse stakeholders. Builds on communication and storytelling skills. Covers data visualizations, audio representations, and interactive dashboards.

## D211: Advanced Data Acquisition

This course enhances SQL skills. This course covers advanced SQL operations, aggregating data, and acquiring data from various sources in support of core organizational needs.

## D212: Data Mining II

This course adds additional tools that incorporates unsupervised models. Explains when, how, and why to use these tools to best meet organizational needs

## D213: Advanced Data Analytics

This course hones the skills in working with models and data. Topics include machine learning, neural networks, randomness, and unconventional data sources.

## D214: Capstone Project

Final project that culminates the knowledge and skills from program.
